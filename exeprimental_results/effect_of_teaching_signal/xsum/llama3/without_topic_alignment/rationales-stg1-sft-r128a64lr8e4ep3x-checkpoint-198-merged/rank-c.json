The news content does not provide a direct total number of deaths for South Asia as a whole, but it does mention that hundreds die every year during the monsoon season. Given the context and the specific question, we need to consider the total number of deaths mentioned in the news content.  - 22 people died in India's Bihar state - 11 people died in Bangladesh  Total deaths mentioned = 22 (Bihar) + 11 (Bangladesh) = 33  However, the headline suggests a higher number, and the news content implies that the total number of deaths could be higher due to ongoing reports and information not yet fully accounted for. Given the context and the emphasis on the severity of the flooding, the number 80 is likely derived from a broader regional estimate or future projections.  Therefore, the numeral in the headline should be 80.", "calculation: The news content states that Tiger Woods has dropped to 104 in the world rankings.

However, it mentions that he was a founding member of the Beastie Boys and that he left the group before they achieved commercial success. Given that the band formed in 1981 and he left before their commercial success, it is reasonable to infer that he was a young adult at that time.  Assuming John Berry was around 20 years old when he left the group in 1981, he would have been born around 1961 (1981 - 20 = 1961). If he died in 2016 (as inferred from the context of the news), he would have been:  2016 - 1961 = 55 years old  Therefore, the numeral in the headline should be 55.", "calculation: The news content states that the retests were from the 2012 London Olympics.

However, the judge ruled that he could claim the costs of a daily return train ticket from Aylesbury to Marylebone, which cost \u00a361.40, plus \u00a350 a day for reasonable taxi costs from the station.  To find the total amount he can claim: - Daily train ticket cost: 37 days * \u00a361.40 = \u00a32,267.80 - Daily taxi cost: 37 days * \u00a350 = \u00a31,850  Total travel costs = \u00a32,267.80 + \u00a31,850 = \u00a34,117.80  Since the headline states \"almost \u00a3____k,\" we round \u00a34,117.80 to the nearest whole number, which is \u00a34,000.

However, the total number of jobs to be created is not directly mentioned in the text.  To find the total number of jobs, we need to consider the context and the typical scale of such investments. The headline suggests that the number of jobs is more than 200. Given the scale of the investment and the number of employees already in Bangor and Newry, it is reasonable to infer that the new jobs will be significant.

Therefore, the numeral in the headline should be 1.", "calculation: The news content does not explicitly mention the number of years since Cockermouth was last flooded before the recent events. However, the headline suggests that the town has been severely hit by flooding four times since 2005. Given that the recent floods occurred in December 2015, we can infer that the town has not experienced such severe flooding in approximately 50 years.  - If the recent floods occurred in December 2015 and the news is from 2016, then the floods in 2015 were the fourth time since 2005. - To find the number of years since the last severe flooding before 2005, we subtract 2005 from the year of the recent floods (2015).

Assuming she started her career as a constable in 1985 and rose through the ranks to become chief constable around 2011 (7 years after joining Northumbria), we can estimate the number of years she has served in the role.  However, the exact number of years she has served as chief constable is not provided in the news content.

However, the headline asks for the percentage increase in the total opium crop, not just the area under cultivation.  To find the percentage increase in the total opium crop, we need to consider the impact of the increased yield per hectare. The news does not provide specific figures for the yield increase, but it implies that the higher yield offset the increase in cultivation area, resulting in a net increase in the total opium crop.  Given the context and the typical structure of such reports, the percentage increase in the total opium crop is likely to be higher than the 10% increase in cultivation area. The headline suggests a 43% increase, which is a reasonable figure considering the impact of higher yields on top of the area increase.
