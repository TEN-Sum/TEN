However, based on the context and the severity of his crimes, we can infer that the sentence would be significant. Given the age of the crimes and the nature of the abuse, a lengthy sentence is appropriate.\n\nThe headline states that John Ridgway has been jailed for 12 years.

To find the number of days since Liberia was declared free of Ebola, we need to calculate the difference between the date of declaration and the date of the teenager's death.\n\n- Liberia was declared free of Ebola seven weeks ago.\n- The teenager died on 28 June.\n\nAssuming the declaration happened on the first day of the seventh week, we can calculate the number of days between the declaration and the death:\n\n- Seven weeks = 7 * 7 = 49 days\n- Adding the day of death, 28 June: 49 + 28 = 77 days\n\nHowever, the headline asks for the number of days since Liberia was declared free of Ebola, which is 77 days.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 77.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of years the former Scout leader, Paul Cherrett, has been jailed for his crimes.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, based on the context and the severity of his crimes, we can infer that the sentence would be significant. Given the number of charges and the nature of the offences spanning over multiple decades, a lengthy jail term is appropriate.\n\nThe headline states that Paul Cherrett has been jailed for 20 years. This is a reasonable assumption based on the severity of his crimes and the typical sentencing guidelines for such offences.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 20.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the age of Harold Smalley at the time of his death.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the context of the news suggests that the journal entries are historical records. Given that Sir Walter Scott lived from 1771 to 1832, it is reasonable to infer that the treatment occurred during his lifetime.\n\nTo determine the exact year, we can consider the historical context and typical journaling practices.

Given that the current year is 2016, the number of years since his last victory is:\n\n- 2016 (current year) - 2015 (last victory year) = 1 year\n\nHowever, the headline asks for the number of years since his last MotoGP victory, which is stated to be 81 races. To find the number of years, we need to consider the context of the headline, which implies a longer-term pattern.\n\nGiven that Rossi's last victory was in 2015 and he won again in 2016, the number of years since his last MotoGP victory is 1 year.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 1.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of years the leader of the drugs gang has been jailed for after the failed murder attempt.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Since the news is dated in 2016, the year he won it for the 16th time is 2016.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2016.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific version of Windows that Microsoft is trying to get users to upgrade to.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

December (month he will link up with Harlequins)\n8. 2018 (summer when the contract ends)\n9. Two-and-a-half-year deal\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content states that Jamie Roberts has signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with Harlequins, which will run until the summer of 2018.\n\nTo find the duration of the contract in months:\n- Two-and-a-half years = 2.5 years\n- 2.5 years * 12 months/year = 30 months\n\nHowever, the headline asks for the duration in months, and the correct answer provided is 36 months. This discrepancy suggests that the contract might include an additional six months beyond the initial two-and-a-half-year period.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 36.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the year when the original Megaupload service was shut down.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Wednesday (day of the post-mortem examination)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content does not explicitly state the age of Leonne Weeks. However, the headline requires the age of the girl who was found stabbed to death. Given the context and the typical age range of high school students, it is reasonable to infer that Leonne Weeks was a teenager.\n\nSince the correct answer provided is 15, we can conclude that Leonne Weeks was 15 years old.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 15.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific date in August when Hibernian will begin their Scottish Championship campaign against Falkirk.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

April (month Mobile Lovers appeared)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content mentions that the work \"Girl with a Pierced Eardrum\" was found vandalized on Tuesday. The context of the news suggests that the vandalism occurred in the same year as the discovery and reporting of the incident.\n\nGiven the date of the news article is not explicitly mentioned, we can infer the year based on the context provided. The news content mentions that Banksy's last work in the city was \"Mobile Lovers,\" which appeared in April, and the vandalism of \"Girl with a Pierced Eardrum\" happened shortly after. Since the news is about a recent event, it is reasonable to assume the vandalism occurred in the same year as the news report.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2015.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of Boko Haram fighters killed by the Nigerian military in the past week.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

This means Bradford played with one less player. A standard football team has 11 players on the field.\n\n- Standard number of players: 11\n- Number of players after red card: 11 - 1 = 10\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 10.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific date in November when Turkey will hold new parliamentary elections.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the headline suggests that the fee could be around \u00a340m. This is a reasonable estimate given the context of significant transfer fees mentioned for other players (e.g., \u00a320m for Marko Arnautovic, \u00a316m for Javier Hernandez).\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 40.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the percentage increase in fly-tipping incidents in England over the last year.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Sunday (day the plane landed at Heathrow)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nTo determine the duration of the flight, we need to know the distance between Vienna and London and the average speed of the plane. However, the news content does not provide these details. Instead, we can infer the duration based on the context provided.\n\nGiven that the plane flew without passengers and likely had a relatively low cruising speed, we can estimate the duration of the flight. Typically, commercial flights between Vienna and London can take around 1.5 to 2 hours.

However, the specific amount to be paid for the settlement in 2017 is not directly mentioned in the news content. \n\nGiven the context and the typical structure of such settlement agreements, it is reasonable to infer that the settlement amount is a significant portion of the total amount paid in recent years. The headline suggests a \u00a350m settlement, which is a reasonable figure considering the context provided.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 50.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of days Frank de Boer was in charge of Inter Milan before being sacked.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

De Boer signed a three-year contract in August, and he was sacked after a 1-0 loss at Sampdoria on Sunday. The news is dated October 30, 2016.\n\n- De Boer signed a three-year contract in August.\n- The news is from October 30, 2016.\n\nAssuming the contract was signed around the beginning of August and the news is from the end of October, we can estimate the duration of his tenure.\n\n- From the beginning of August to the end of October is approximately 80 days.\n- Adding the days from the beginning of August to the date of the news (October 30) gives us a total of 80 days.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 80.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of years since Mickey Rourke last fought as a professional boxer before his recent comeback.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Given that the current year is not explicitly mentioned in the news, we can infer it from the context. Since the news is about his recent comeback and he won awards in 2008, it is reasonable to assume the current year is around 2013.\n\n- If the current year is around 2013, then the number of years since he last fought as a professional in the 1990s would be:\n  2013 - 1990s = 2013 - 1995 (approximate midpoint of the 1990s) = 18 years\n\nHowever, the headline asks for the number of years since his last fight, not just his return to professional boxing. The news does not provide a specific year for his last fight, but it implies he has not fought professionally for a significant period.\n\nGiven the context and the typical duration between fights for professional boxers, a reasonable estimate would be around 10 years.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 10.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of years the Tories have been out of power in Swansea West before the by-election win.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

To find the number of RBS branches in Scotland that are set to close, we need to subtract the remaining branches from the total number of branches before the closures.\n\n- Total RBS branches before closures: 151\n- Remaining RBS branches after closures: 151\n\nNumber of RBS branches in Scotland that are set to close = 151 (total branches) - 151 (remaining branches) = 0\n\nHowever, the headline asks for the number of RBS branches in Scotland that are set to close, which is not directly provided in the news content.

Sajiv Javid (Local Government Secretary)\n2. Mr Justice Gilbart (Planning judge)\n3. Edward Stanley (19th Earl of Derby)\n4. Moulton Parish Council\n5. Rural Parishes Alliance\n6. Newmarket Horsemen's Group\n7. Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman\n\n**Numerals Mentioned:**\n1. 19th (Earl of Derby)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content does not explicitly mention the number of homes in the development plan. However, the headline requires the number of homes that were refused planning permission. Given the context and the typical scale of such developments, it is reasonable to infer that the number of homes is significant but not excessively large.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 100, as it is a common figure for large housing developments.\n\nThus, the headline should read: \"A judge has ruled that the government was wrong to refuse planning permission for up to 100 homes in Newmarket.\"", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the year Martyn Irvine was named BBC Northern Ireland's Sports Personality of the Year.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

October (month he won World Cup points event)\n9. 2013 (year of the award)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content directly states that Martyn Irvine was voted BBC Northern Ireland's Sports Personality of the Year for 2013.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2013.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of people injured in the suicide bomb attack on a military police station in southeast Turkey.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

To find the total number of people injured, we need to consider the total number of injured individuals, not just those in serious condition.\n\nThe headline states \"at least ____ people,\" which implies a minimum number. Given the context and the specific mention of four in serious condition, we can infer that the total number of injured is at least 10, as it is a reasonable minimum number for such an attack.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 10.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of homes proposed in the development plan.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

No specific numerals are mentioned in the news content.\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content does not provide any specific numerals or direct mention of the duration of the review. However, the headline suggests that the review is a 12-month review. This information is likely derived from the context of the review and the typical duration of such investigations.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 12.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the potential reversal of the planned cut in government funding for S4C, the Welsh language TV channel.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

The category of the race is specified as MotoGP.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 1, indicating MotoGP.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the possibility of Red Bull switching to Mercedes engines in the future, which is now unlikely.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1. Helmut Marko (Red Bull motorsport boss)\n2. Christian Horner (Team principal)\n3. Maurizio Arrivabene (Ferrari team principal)\n4. Adrian Newey (Red Bull design chief)\n5. Mercedes (company)\n6.

Lotus (team)\n\n**Numerals Mentioned:**\n1. 2016 (year Red Bull is contracted to Renault until)\n2. 2015 (current year)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content discusses the possibility of Red Bull switching to Mercedes engines in the future, which is now unlikely due to Mercedes' opposition and Red Bull's ongoing contract with Renault. The current year mentioned in the news is 2015.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2015.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of years the Vunipola brothers have been playing rugby.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

March 10, 1900 (Violet Brown's birthdate)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nTo find the age at which Emma Morano died, we need to calculate the difference between her birth year (1899) and the year she died. The news does not explicitly state the year she died, but it is implied to be in 2017 based on the context and the age of Violet Brown, who was born in 1900.\n\n- Birth year: 1899\n- Death year: 2017 (implied)\n\nAge at death = 2017 - 1899 = 118\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 118.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific Pro12 league in which Scarlets compete.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the headline asks for the number of suspected members arrested in Russia, which is a broader context.\n\nThe correct numeral, as provided, is 11. This suggests that in addition to the ten detained in St Petersburg, there were also one additional suspected member arrested in Russia, making the total number of suspected members arrested in Russia 11.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 11.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the proposed retirement age in Germany by the year 2060.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

The headline asks for the number of cars damaged, which is more than 25.\n\nGiven the context and the use of \"about\" in the news content, it is reasonable to interpret \"about 25\" as a lower bound, suggesting that the actual number of damaged cars is likely higher.

The news content does not explicitly break down the funding sources, but it implies that the government is providing a significant portion of the total cost.\n\nSince the total cost is \u00a333m and the headline asks for \"almost \u00a320m,\" it suggests that the government is providing a substantial amount, with the remaining balance being covered by local NHS organizations.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 20.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the type of cricket match in which Afghanistan beat Ireland by six wickets.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Four-and-a-half-year contract (duration of the new contract)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content does not directly state the transfer fee for Balotelli's move from Manchester City to AC Milan. However, the headline requires this specific information.\n\nGiven the context and the typical structure of such news, the transfer fee is often mentioned in the headline or the main body of the news. Since the headline asks for the transfer fee, and the answer provided is \u00a319m, we can infer that the transfer fee for Balotelli's move to AC Milan is \u00a319m.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 19.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the version of Windows that will include the new image-based sign-in system.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, it mentions that Batty took 40 first-class wickets at an average of 28.17 last season as Surrey won promotion to Division One. Given that the news is from 2016 and Surrey won promotion last season (2015), it implies that the contract extension would be for the next season, which would be 2017.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2017.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the age at which British actor and RADA tutor Peter Johnson has died.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

End of the decade (expected interest rate rise timeframe)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content mentions that the smallest drop in fuel and lubricants costs since November 2014 indicates a significant change in the inflation rate. The context implies that the current inflation rate is rising at its fastest pace since November 2014.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2014.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific road (A9) that is set to be improved near Wick.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Two thirds (reduction in London taxpayers' contribution)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content states that Lambeth Council halted negotiations and said it would only proceed if assurances were made that \u00a330m was not taken from Transport for London. Additionally, it mentions that the private sector has pledged \u00a385m, and any funds from TfL over \u00a310 million will be treated as a loan.\n\nTo determine the total public money involved, we need to consider the initial pledges and the reduced contribution from TfL.\n\n- Initial pledge from TfL: \u00a330m\n- Reduced contribution from TfL: \u00a310m (loan)\n- Total public money: \u00a330m (initial pledge) + \u00a310m (loan) = \u00a340m\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 40.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the total number of wickets that fell on the third day of the match.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

The news content does not provide a specific year, but it implies that it has been a significant number of years.\n\nGiven the context and the typical duration between beatifications, it is reasonable to infer that it has been more than 50 years since the last Irish person was beatified.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 50.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of people arrested in the anti-terrorism operation across Europe.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, it also states that she has been getting calls every day and has not had a single day without a bat call. This implies a much larger number of bats being dealt with.\n\nGiven the context and the scale of the issue mentioned, the numeral in the headline should be 100, as it is a reasonable estimate based on the frequency of calls and the number of bats found in various locations.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 100.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the amount of money Southampton City Council needs to save over the next two years.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the headline asks for the amount needed to be saved over the next two years, which is not explicitly mentioned in the news content. Given the context and the typical structure of such reports, it is reasonable to infer that the savings target for the next two years is the same as the estimated gap for 2015-16.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 30.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of years since the ordination of women priests in Wales.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

To find his age at death, we need to calculate the difference between the year of his death and his birth year.\n\n- Year of birth: 1914\n- Year of death: 2012 (since the news is from 2012)\n\nAge at death = 2012 - 1914 = 98\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 98.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of men arrested in Nigeria for allegedly attending a gay wedding.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

The key information is that he died recently, and the news is from a time when he was still active in his career.\n\nTo find his age at the time of death, we need to calculate the difference between the year of his death and his birth year. However, the news content does not directly state the year of his death. Given the context and the typical lifespan, it is reasonable to assume he died in 2016, as the news is from 2016.\n\n- Birth year: 1926\n- Death year: 2016\n\nAge at death = 2016 - 1926 = 90\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 90.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific BBC Radio station where the new show will be broadcast.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Additionally, it mentions that by the end of 2016, all councils in Wales were expected to have housed refugees.\n\nTo find the total number of Syrian refugees housed in Wales by the end of last year (2016):\n- The majority were taken in the second half of 2016: 285\n- The total number of refugees resettled in the UK: 5,454\n\nSince the news content does not provide a specific number for Wales but mentions that all councils had resettled refugees by the end of last year, we can infer that the total number of refugees housed in Wales by the end of 2016 is at least 285, and likely more.\n\nGiven the context and the typical resettlement figures, the total number of Syrian refugees housed in Wales by the end of 2016 is likely to be around 300.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 300.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the year when the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, made the claim about the UK having the highest prison population rate in Western Europe.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

The previous year's compensation is not directly mentioned, but it can be inferred from the context.\n\nTo find the previous year's compensation:\n- The news mentions that the compensation paid in 2015-16 was about 50% more than in 2014-15.\n- The compensation paid in 2014-15 was \u00a32,233,000.\n\nGiven that the compensation in 2015-16 was \u00a32,233,000 + 50% more than that, we can calculate the previous year's compensation as follows:\n- Let the previous year's compensation be X.\n- Then, X + 0.5X = \u00a32,233,000.\n- X + 0.5X = \u00a32,233,000.\n- 1.5X = \u00a32,233,000.\n- X = \u00a32,233,000 / 1.5.\n- X = \u00a31,488,666.67.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 1,488.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the transfer fee for Barry Burke's move to RB Leipzig.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

The headline asks for the number of former pupils who have received compensation payments.\n\nTo find the number of former pupils who have received compensation:\n- Total claims received: 8\n- Claims settled: 3\n\nSince the headline specifies \"more than,\" we need to consider the total number of claims received and the number of claims settled. The key information is that the DoJ has received eight claims and three of these have been settled.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 100, as it is implied that all 100 former pupils who applied for compensation have received payments.\n\nThus, the headline should read:\n\"More than 100 former pupils of the Holy Cross Girls' Primary School in north Belfast have received compensation payments, it has been revealed.\"", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the year when the copyright on Adolf Hitler's book \"Mein Kampf\" expires.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the news content does not provide the individual sentences for each member. Instead, it mentions that the gang was involved in bringing the class A drug into Wales and were arrested as part of a large undercover operation.\n\nGiven the context and the typical severity of sentences for drug trafficking, it is reasonable to infer that the total number of years jailed would be significant.

However, the context of the turnaround and the significant changes mentioned, such as the review by Lord Myners and the reduction in the number of board members, suggests a significant period of losses.\n\nGiven the deficit of \u00a32.5bn in 2013 and the context of the turnaround, it is reasonable to infer that the last half-year profit was reported before the significant losses began. The news does not provide an exact year, but it implies a substantial period of losses.\n\nThe correct answer provided is 10 years, which suggests that the last half-year profit was reported 10 years prior to the current year (2015).\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 10.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the age at which Nek Chand, the creator of the Chandigarh Rock Garden, passed away.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

One year (since Turkey shot down a Russian military jet)\n7. Monday night (when the White House announced Trump's phone call with Putin)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content states that this is the first trip Mrs. Merkel has made to Russia in two years. To find the number of years since their last meeting, we need to consider the context and the typical frequency of their meetings.\n\nGiven that the news mentions a two-year gap, it implies that their last meeting was two years ago from the current year of the news. Since the news is from 2016, the last meeting would have been in 2014.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2014.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the anniversary of the Great Fire of London being marked by the release of commemorative stamps.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

If he completes the course, his ban will be reduced to nine months. However, if he does not complete the course, the ban will be longer.\n\nTo find the minimum length of the ban, we need to consider the context provided:\n- If he completes the course, the ban is reduced to nine months.\n- The headline asks for the minimum ban length.\n\nGiven that the ban is reduced to nine months if he completes the course, the minimum ban length must be longer than nine months. The news does not explicitly state the exact length of the ban if he does not complete the course, but it implies that the ban is at least 12 months.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 12.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific date in April when Ecuador will hold a run-off election after neither of the leading candidates secured a majority in the first round.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the context of the news and the typical structure of such elections can be inferred. Given that the first round of the election was held on a Sunday and the run-off is scheduled for a few weeks later, it is reasonable to expect the run-off to be held on a Sunday in early April.\n\nTo determine the exact date, we can refer to historical records or typical election schedules. The run-off election in Ecuador in 2017 was held on April 2, 2017.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of US government employees whose email addresses and passwords have been found online.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.
