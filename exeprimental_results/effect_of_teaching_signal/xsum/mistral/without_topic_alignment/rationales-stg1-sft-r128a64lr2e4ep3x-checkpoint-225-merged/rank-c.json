The news content does not explicitly state the percentage of MPs who supported the changes, but it implies that the support was significant. Given the context and the typical size of the Indian parliament, we can infer that the support was widespread.  Assuming a hypothetical percentage of 90% of MPs supported the changes:  - 90% of 543 MPs (the total number of MPs in the Indian parliament) = 0.90 * 543 = 490.7  Rounding to the nearest whole number, the number of MPs who supported the changes is approximately 500.

Assuming each week has 7 days, we calculate:  13 weeks * 7 days/week = 91 days  However, the news mentions \"just a week\" since changing his putter and putting coach, which suggests a shorter period.

The headline asks for the number of ancient jade artefacts, which is a specific subset of the total number of cultural relics found.  To determine the number of ancient jade artefacts, we need to consider the context provided by the news content. The coiled jade dragon is mentioned as one of the earliest known depictions of the mythological creature, and it is likely to be a significant and rare artefact. Given the context and the emphasis on the importance of the coiled jade dragon, it is reasonable to infer that the number of ancient jade artefacts found is a significant portion of the total number of cultural relics.  Given the total number of cultural relics found is 1,168, and considering the prominence of the coiled jade dragon, it is reasonable to estimate that approximately 100 ancient jade artefacts were found.

The ban finishes on 28 March, and the Six Nations campaign ends on 19 March. Given that the ban starts before the Six Nations campaign, we need to calculate the number of days from the end of the ban to the start of the campaign.  - End of ban: 28 March - Six Nations campaign ends: 19 March - Current date: 22 January  Assuming the ban starts immediately after the current date (22 January), we can calculate the number of days from 28 March to 22 January: - 28 March to 22 January = 65 days  However, the news content does not specify the exact start date of the ban. Given the context and typical suspension durations, it is reasonable to infer that the ban starts on the first day of the Six Nations campaign, which is 6 February.

The news content does not explicitly state the current number of graduates, but it does state that the government wants to increase the number of home-grown doctors by 25%.  - Current number of graduates: 6,000 - New target number of graduates: 7,500  Percentage increase = [(7,500 - 6,000) / 6,000] * 100                   = [1,500 / 6,000] * 100                   = 0.25 * 100                   = 25%  Therefore, the number of extra medical school places is 25%.  To convert this percentage into a whole number: - 25% of 6,000 is approximately 1,500.  Therefore, the numeral in the headline should be 1.", "calculation: The news content states that the area used to farm poppies increased by 10% to 201,000 hectares.
