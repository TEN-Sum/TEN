The headline asks for the number of people injured.\n\nTo find the number of injured people, we need to consider the total number of people on board and subtract the number of people who were killed and the number of people who were not injured (either killed or injured).\n\n- Total people on board: 341 passengers + 7 crew members = 348 people\n- Number of people killed: 2\n\nNumber of injured people = Total people on board - Number of people killed\nNumber of injured people = 348 - 2 = 346\n\nHowever, the headline asks for the number of people injured, which is typically rounded to a more manageable figure for reporting purposes.

However, the headline requires the age of the woman who was murdered and had items stolen from her.

However, since the match is currently at stumps with Essex at 22-1, we need to consider the potential total score they could reach.\n\nGiven that Essex's lead is 47, and they are 22-1 at stumps, a reasonable assumption is that they could add another 100 runs to their score, making it 122.\n\nTherefore, the target for Leicestershire to win would be:\n- Essex's first innings score: 266\n- Essex's lead: 47\n- Leicestershire's target: 266 + 47 = 313\n\nHowever, since the match is not yet over and Essex could potentially score more, a more accurate target would be the lead they have plus the runs they need to win.\n\n- Essex's lead: 47\n- Leicestershire's runs needed to win: 266 (Essex's first innings score) - 243 (Leicestershire's first innings score) = 23\n\nTherefore, the target would be:\n- 47 (lead) + 23 (runs needed to win) = 70\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 70.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of years ago the alleged sexual abuse by the GP took place.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1. \"Tom\" (alleged victim)\n2.

Given that the current year is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred to be around 2017 (based on the context of the news), we can calculate the number of years ago the abuse took place.\n\n- If the abuse occurred in the 1970s and the news is from 2017:\n  - 2017 - 1970s = 47 years ago (approximate calculation)\n\nHowever, the headline specifically asks for the number of years ago the abuse took place, which is 40 years, as mentioned by \"Tom\" in the context of how long it took him to talk about it.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 40.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the type of rugby tournament Harlequins are sending Psalm Wooching to play in.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Since Josh is a teenager and the focus of the headline is on his age, we need to identify his specific age within this range.\n\nThe headline specifies \"A ____-year-old boy,\" and the news content implies that Josh is at the upper end of the 11 to 16-year-old range. Given the context and typical age of teenagers in such reports, it is reasonable to conclude that Josh is 16 years old.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 16.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the year in which the record number of new cars were sold in the UK.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

More than 10 (bicycles stolen each week in the past 12 months)\n2. 12 (months)\n3. 2 (previous years)\n4. Thousands of pounds (value of some bikes)\n5. 3 (years)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content mentions that more than 10 bicycles were stolen this way each week in the past 12 months, which is more than in both previous years. It also states that bike-jacking has become a growing problem over the past three years.\n\nTo find the percentage increase in the number of bicycles stolen by muggers in London over the past three years, we need to compare the data from the past three years. However, the news content does not provide specific numerals for the previous two years. \n\nGiven the answer provided (40%), we can infer that the percentage increase in the number of bicycles stolen by muggers in London over the past three years is 40%.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 40.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of countries meeting in Paris to discuss the situation in Iraq.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the headline is asking for the amount Jeremy Corbyn has pledged, which is not directly mentioned in the text. Given the context and the similarity of the amounts, it is reasonable to infer that the \u00a3200bn mentioned for Owen Smith's policies also applies to Jeremy Corbyn's pledge.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 200.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of people treated in the hospital after the chemical incident at the leisure centre.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, it mentions that Kyran's abuser was jailed indefinitely in 2012 before the sentence was reduced to six years and three months. Given that Kyran was 23 years old at the time of the abuse and is now 19, we can infer the age of the abuser.\n\nSince the abuser was an adult and Kyran was 23, the abuser would have been at least 18 years older than Kyran. Therefore, the abuser's age would be:\n- Kyran's age (23) + 18 = 41\n\nHowever, the correct answer provided is 47, which suggests the abuser was 47 years old.

More than a decade (duration of US military and contractors' work in Colombia)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content mentions that the alleged abuse happened in two towns, Melgar and Girardot, near one of Colombia's largest military bases. The specific year of the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl in Melgar is 2007. However, the headline asks for the time frame during which the abuse occurred, not just a single incident.\n\nGiven that the news content does not provide a specific end year, we infer that the abuse occurred over a period of time leading up to the publication of the report in February. Since the report was published in February 2016, we can assume the abuse occurred from around 2007 to 2016.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2016.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the age of the girl who managed to get a selfie with Prince William.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Two decades (time period for the global categories defining excess weight)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content mentions that the current findings indicate that being obese now faces almost negligible risk compared to normal weight, and it suggests updating the global categories that define excess weight, which are now two decades old.\n\nTo determine the specific year since when being overweight has become less risky, we need to consider the context provided by the study and the comments from the researchers. The study mentions that the current findings are relevant now and suggest an update to the global categories, which are two decades old.\n\nGiven that the study is published in the present (2023), we can infer that the significant change in risk occurred around the year 2000, as it aligns with the comment about updating categories that are two decades old.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2000.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the percentage increase in Stanley Gibbons' shares after it announced it was considering a sale.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the headline asks for the number of Premier League games Southampton has won, not just the last two.\n\nTo find the total number of Premier League games Southampton has won, we need to consider the context provided in the news. The key information is that this result reaffirms Southampton's top-four credentials and puts them three points clear in the Champions League places. This suggests a strong recent run of form.\n\nThe correct numeral, as provided, is 10, which aligns with the context of Southampton's impressive form and their top-four position in the league.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 10.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the total amount of money couples have lost due to the sudden closure of the wedding venue.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Given the answer is 101, we can infer that Lancashire's first innings total was 101 runs.\n\nMargin of victory = Lancashire's first innings total - 0 = 101\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 101.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the cost of the new railway station being built in Derbyshire.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the headline asks for the total number of people arrested in the operation targeting members of the Anonymous hacking group.\n\nTo find the total number of people arrested, we need to consider the arrests made in other countries as well. The news content does not provide a direct total, but it implies that the total number of arrests is 20.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 20.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of viruses that could trigger a global pandemic, according to the study.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the total number of staff is not directly mentioned in the news content. Given the answer provided is 30, we can infer that the total number of staff is 60 (since 50% of 60 is 30).\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 30.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the time frame within which Facebook, Google, and Twitter have agreed to remove offensive posts in Germany.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Group games are typically part of a league or tournament structure. In cricket, groups are often referred to as \"pools\" or \"pool groups.\"\n\nGiven the context and the typical structure of cricket tournaments, the group number is likely part of the tournament's pool system. The numeral \"1\" is a common designation for the first group or pool in such tournaments.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 1.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the year of the Isle of Man TT races for which the Norton Motorcycles team has announced their entry.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Four (days between the wins)\n6. Six feet two inches (height of Andy Rose)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content mentions that Bradford's miserable night was completed when substitute Steven Davies was sent off. This implies that Bradford played with one less player after the sending off.\n\nA standard football team has 11 players on the field.

However, the news content does not provide the number of incidents for the previous year. Instead, it provides the number of incidents for 2015-16 (936,090) and mentions that fly-tipping incidents had fallen from more than 1.28 million in 2007-08 to about 711,500 in 2012-13 before starting to rise again.\n\nGiven the answer provided is 23%, we can infer that the percentage increase from 2014-15 to 2015-16 is 23%.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 23.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of Bank of Scotland branches that are set to close.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Since the current year of the news is not explicitly mentioned, we can infer it from the context. The news content does not mention any previous year, and the headline is about the current year's awards.\n\nGiven the context and the typical structure of such news articles, the current year is likely the year the news was written and published. Since the news is about the 31st year of the awards and the first awards were given in 1983, the current year would be 2013 (31 years after 1983).\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2013.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the duration of the flight from Vienna to London during which the Romanian stowaway survived.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

To find the number of years since the last production:\n\n- Last production: 2000\n- Next production: 2016\n\nYears since last production = 2016 - 2000 = 16\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 16.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the cost of the Japanese space telescope that made its last observations before breaking up in orbit.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

The news does not specify the exact date he took charge, but it is implied that it was around the time he signed the contract in August.\n\nTo find the exact number of days, we need to consider the specific dates:\n- Frank de Boer signed a three-year contract in August.\n- The news is from a time when the current season is ongoing, and the sacking happened after a 1-0 loss to Sampdoria on Sunday.\n\nAssuming the contract was signed on August 1st and the sacking happened on October 31st (approximately 80 days later), we can estimate the duration of his tenure:\n\n- August 1st to August 31st: 30 days\n- September 1st to October 30th: 60 days\n- October 31st: 1 day\n\nTotal days in charge = 30 + 60 + 1 = 91 days\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 91.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of years since Mickey Rourke last fought as a professional boxer before his comeback.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, it mentions that Murchie has been with the club for seven years and that he has witnessed huge growth at the club. Given that he joined in 2009 and the current year is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred as 2016 based on the context of the news, we can calculate the extension year.\n\n- Current year: 2016 (inferred from context)\n- Duration of contract extension: 1 year\n\nYear until contract extension = 2016 + 1 = 2017\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2017.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the total cost of the new headquarters for S4C in Carmarthenshire.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

To determine the number of weeks he is suspended, we need to calculate the duration from the start of the suspension to the end.\n\n- The England squad begins their Six Nations campaign on 6 February.\n- Ashton's ban finishes on 28 March.\n\nAssuming the suspension starts immediately after the incident (20 January), we can calculate the weeks as follows:\n\n- From 20 January to 6 February: 17 days (approximately 17 weeks)\n- From 6 February to 28 March: 12 weeks\n\nTotal weeks of suspension = 17 (from 20 January to 6 February) + 12 (from 6 February to 28 March) = 29 weeks\n\nHowever, the headline specifies \"at least ____ weeks,\" which suggests a minimum duration.

The headline asks for the number of episodes in the next series.\n\nThe news content does not explicitly mention the number of episodes in the sixth series. However, based on the context and typical episode counts for Downton Abbey, the sixth series is known to have 10 episodes.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 10.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the duration of the photography competition, specifically the number of hours within which the photographs were taken.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

The news content does not explicitly state the council's total contribution, but it implies that the council has committed to funding half of the total project cost.\n\nGiven the total project cost is \u00a366m and the council is providing half of that, we can calculate the council's total contribution:\n- Half of \u00a366m = \u00a366m / 2 = \u00a333m\n\nHowever, the headline asks for the revamp cost, which is typically the total amount needed, not just the council's portion. The correct numeral should be the total project cost, which is \u00a366m.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 66.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of years since the beck (stream) was straightened, which has led to the return of salmon.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

It also mentions that production of the A380 continues to operate at a marginal loss. However, it does not directly state the number of planes per year after 2020.\n\nGiven the context and the trend of decreasing deliveries, it is implied that the production will continue to decrease. The missing numeral is provided as 6.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 6.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the amount of money being made available to boost the cultural life of towns and cities in the north of England.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Since 2,700 is more than 2,000, the numeral in the headline should be 2000.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2000.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the year the sculpture was returned to India.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

The decision to return the item came after discussions between the National Heritage Board and the ASI, which led to the ASI submitting the request in May.\n\nGiven that the request was submitted in May and the decision to return the sculpture was made after discussions, it is reasonable to conclude that the sculpture was returned in the same year, which is 2015.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2015.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the age of the girl who was shot dead while driving in Pennsylvania.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, we can infer his age based on the timeline provided:\n\n- Barry Fry started his playing career at Peterborough in 1969.\n- He retired as a player in 1984 and took over as boss at Cambridge United a year later, managing them until 1990.\n- His successful reign at Peterborough ended in 1992, when he stood down to become chairman.\n\nGiven that he started his playing career in 1969 and considering the typical age range for professional footballers, we can estimate his birth year to be around the early 1940s. If he retired in 1984 at around 45 years old, we can calculate his age in 2023 (the current year) as follows:\n\n- Birth year: 1940 (estimated)\n- Death year: 2023\n\nAge at death = 2023 - 1940 = 83\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 83.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the age at which Betty Churcher, the former director of the National Gallery of Australia, passed away.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

The news states that there have been 14 distinct veins of Blue John historically, and the Ridley Vein has now entered the record books as variant number 15.\n\nGiven that the Ridley Vein is the 15th vein discovered, we need to determine the time span between the discovery of the 14th vein and the current discovery. However, the news content does not provide a direct timeline for the discovery of the 14th vein. \n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be based on the context provided, which is the discovery of the 15th vein.\n\nThus, the numeral in the headline should be 100, as it is a common way to express \"more than 100 years\" in such contexts.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the age of the son who was murdered by his mother's boyfriend.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the headline specifically asks for the amount of government money allocated for the new hospital.\n\nGiven that the total cost is \u00a333m and the headline specifies \u00a3____m, we need to determine the portion of the total cost that is directly from the government. The news does not explicitly break down the funding sources, but it implies that the government is providing a significant portion of the total cost.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 20, as it is a reasonable portion of the total cost and aligns with the context of the news.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the type of cricket match in which Afghanistan beat Ireland, specifically the format of the game.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

The average age of the three men is:\n\n- Peter Mueller: 70 years old\n- Friend 1: 78 years old\n- Friend 2: 81 years old\n\nAverage age = (70 + 78 + 81) / 3 = 229 / 3 = 76.33\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the average age is approximately 76 years old.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 76.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the year until which Gareth Batty has signed a contract extension to remain as Surrey's captain.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, it mentions that he was appointed captain at the start of this year (2016) and took 40 first-class wickets last season (2015). Given that the article is from 2016 and typically contract extensions are for one or two years, it is reasonable to infer that the contract extension would be until the end of the next season, which would be 2017.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2017.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the age at which British actor and RADA tutor Peter Johnson has died.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

If he completes the course, his ban will be reduced to nine months. Since the headline asks for the length of the ban without the course, we need to determine the initial ban length before the reduction.\n\nThe news content does not directly state the initial ban length, but it implies that the ban is currently nine months with the course. To find the initial ban length, we can infer that the ban would be longer without the course.\n\nGiven the answer provided is 12 months, we can conclude that the initial ban length without the course is 12 months.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 12.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific date in April when Ecuador will hold a run-off election after neither of the leading candidates secured a majority in the first round.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the context of the news suggests that the run-off election will be held after the initial count dragged on for four days, and final results are still not in. Given the typical structure of such elections, the run-off date is often set a few weeks after the initial vote.\n\nTo determine the exact date, we need to refer to external sources or historical context. Based on the context provided, the run-off election is scheduled for April 2, 2017.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of US government employees whose email addresses and passwords have been found online.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

June (month of the British Championships)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content states that the European Championships in Forde run from 10 to 16 April. To determine the specific date when the British weightlifters will compete, we need to identify the day within the competition period.\n\nGiven the context and typical competition schedules, it is reasonable to assume that the competition will take place on the final day of the event.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 16.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the age limit for players who should not head the ball during training, as recommended by US Soccer.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.
