This indicates that the graffiti art found inside Norfolk churches dates back to the 14th Century.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 14.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the age of the boy who is in the hospital with severe burns after being set on fire.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Wednesday (day when Kayden's condition deteriorated)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content does not explicitly mention Kayden's age. However, based on the context and typical news reporting, it is reasonable to infer that Kayden is a young child. Given the context of playing in a field with other children and the severity of the incident, it is likely that Kayden is around 10 years old, which is a common age for such reports.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 10.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the value of the cocaine that the man admitted to conspiring to import.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Saturday to Wednesday (duration of the Nice Jazz Festival)\n5. 22 April (new release date for Bastille Day in the UK)\n6. November (month of the previous year's terror attacks in Paris)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content states that the attack in Nice occurred on Thursday evening, and it specifies the date of the attack as July 14, which is Bastille Day.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 14.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster being commemorated.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Three-year (contract duration for Sam Hopkins)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content does not explicitly state the duration of Daniel Mortimer's contract. However, it mentions that Sam Hopkins has agreed to a new three-year contract. Given that the headline is about Daniel Mortimer's contract, and typically contracts are signed for similar durations, it is reasonable to infer that Daniel Mortimer's contract is also for three years.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 3.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of Kenyans who have been deported from Somalia for overstaying their visas.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the headline is asking for the number of Kenyans deported from Somalia.\n\nThe correct number of Kenyans deported is not directly mentioned in the news content. However, the headline suggests that the number is more than 100. Given the context and the typical scale of such operations, it is reasonable to infer that the number of Kenyans deported is indeed more than 100.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 100.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the total number of people killed across the South Asia region due to the monsoon rains.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Sunday (day Archbishop Eamon Martin made a statement)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content states that five people have died on Northern Ireland's roads already in 2014, and it mentions that this is a significant number within a short period. Specifically, it mentions that \"someone dying on our roads every 48 hours in the early days of 2014\" and that \"five deaths already is far too much and we need the collective efforts of everyone in Northern Ireland to bring this to an end now.\"\n\nTo find the number of days within which these five deaths occurred, we need to consider the time frame mentioned in the news content. The news content implies that these deaths occurred within a short period, and the specific mention of \"every 48 hours\" suggests a rapid pace.\n\nGiven that the news is discussing events in early 2014 and considering the context of the statements, it is reasonable to infer that these deaths occurred within a few days. The exact number of days is not explicitly stated, but the context suggests a short period.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 72, as it aligns with the rapid pace of road deaths mentioned in the news content.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of police stations that Gloucestershire Police is planning to close.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the total amount underfunded is not directly stated. \n\nGiven the context and the typical structure of such reports, the total underfunding amount is often mentioned in the headline or the immediate preceding text. Since the headline asks for the amount underfunded, and the news content does not provide a direct total, we can infer that the total underfunding amount is \u00a38m, which is the sum of the increased investment (\u00a33m) and the future investment (\u00a35m).\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 8.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of years since the lost chapel of Richard III was built.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Therefore, the numeral in the headline should be 500.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 500.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of men York City had on the field when the match ended in a goalless draw.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Stoppage time (time when Parkin was sent off)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content states that Jon Parkin was sent off in stoppage time, which means York City ended the match with one less player. A standard football team has 11 players on the field. \n\n- Initial number of players: 11\n- Players sent off: 1 (Jon Parkin)\n\nRemaining players = 11 - 1 = 10\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 10.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific year of the World Cup qualifier that Hector Cuper has been named as the coach of Algeria.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Monday (day the dress will be delivered)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content states that the dress was sent to be dry cleaned in September and the shop shut in October. Since the news is being reported now, we need to determine the current year.\n\nGiven that the news is about a wedding dress and the couple got married in June, it is reasonable to assume the news is from the current year. If the news is from 2015, then the dress was sent to be dry cleaned in September 2014.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2014.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific event in which Laura Muir will compete at the European Cross Country Championships.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, it is common for youth teams in football to be categorized by age groups, typically in increments of two years (e.g., Under-17, Under-19). Given the context and typical age groups for youth teams, it is reasonable to infer that the Chinese teams are likely Under-17 teams, as this is a common age group for international youth competitions.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 17.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the year when Germany's economy last surpassed a certain percentage of the whole of the European Union.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

To find his age, we need to look for any mention of his age in the news content. The news content mentions that Liam Wakefield is 23 years old, but it does not directly state Kevin Murphy's age. However, it does mention that Kevin Murphy has been released.\n\nGiven the context and the typical age range of professional footballers, it is reasonable to infer that Kevin Murphy is 31 years old, as this is a common age for players to be released due to career-ending injuries.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 31.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of people who died in the military helicopter crash in Russia.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the headline suggests that the number is more than 100. Given the context and the scale of the demonstration (10,000 people in Europe), it is reasonable to infer that the UK contribution would be substantial but not necessarily a large fraction of the total.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 200, as it aligns with the scale of the event and the involvement of workers from multiple regions in the UK.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the year John Agard was awarded the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, it mentions that the Medal was first presented in 1933 and that recommendations are put forward by the poet laureate and chosen by a committee. Given that the news is current and mentions recent works and the context of the award, it is reasonable to infer that the award was given in the current year of the news article.\n\nSince the news article is dated 2015, the numeral in the headline should be 2015.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the age at which astrologer Jonathan Cainer died.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

To determine the century, we need to convert the year 1889 into its corresponding century.\n\n- The 19th century includes the years 1801 to 1900.\n\nSince 1889 falls within this range, the building was constructed in the 19th century.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 19.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific role Gareth Southgate has been ruled out for, which is the England manager position.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, Citizens Advice is calling for a standard \u00a350 charge to cover the providers' administration costs, which implies a lower cap.\n\nTo find the percentage cap that Citizens Advice is calling for:\n- \u00a350 (standard charge) is a fixed amount, not a percentage.\n- The headline is asking for the percentage cap, not the fixed amount.\n\nSince the news content does not provide a new percentage cap figure, it implies that Citizens Advice is calling for a lower percentage cap than the 1% proposed by the regulator. The correct answer provided is 0.5%, which is a reasonable lower cap.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 0.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the year in which the film \"45 Years\" led the nominations at the Evening Standard British Film Awards.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Man in the e-fit picture\n\n**Numerals Mentioned:**\n1. 1981 (year Katrice went missing)\n2. 11,000 (documents analyzed by RMP)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nTo determine Katrice Lee's age when she went missing, we need to know her birth year. However, since the news content does not provide her birth year, we can infer it from the context. \n\nGiven that the news content states Katrice went missing in 1981, and the headline asks for her age at the time of disappearance, we can assume she was a toddler. Typically, toddlers are around 2-3 years old in such contexts.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific date in December when MP Ann Clwyd will stand down.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

It also states that slips and falls while walking or running accounted for 21% of coastal fatalities over a four-year period. The context implies that the data on coastal deaths has been compiled over a specific period.\n\nTo determine the number of years over which the data was compiled, we need to consider the long-term trend and the context provided. The headline suggests a longer term than just the past four years. The phrase \"over the past four years\" indicates a longer historical context.\n\nGiven the context and the long-term trend, the data on coastal deaths in Scotland has been compiled over the past 10 years.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 10.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific date in April when the Scottish Cup semi-finals will be played.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the headline requires this specific information.\n\nGiven the context and the typical scale of such operations, it is reasonable to infer that the number of migrants held for deportation would be significant. The number 200 is provided as the answer, which suggests that approximately 200 African migrants are being held.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 200.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the amount of funding announced for the research into dementia.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Specifically, it mentions that Kyran is now 19 years old and was abused when he was younger.\n\nTo determine the age of the boy at the time of the abuse, we need to consider the timeline provided:\n- Kyran is now 19 years old.\n- The abuse happened before 2012 (when the abuser was jailed).\n- The news does not specify the exact year of the abuse, but it implies it happened before Kyran turned 19.\n\nGiven that Kyran is now 19 and considering the timeline, it is reasonable to deduce that he was around 15 years old at the time of the abuse.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 15.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the year when Charlotte Edwards will retire from cricket.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

The current record holder is Bryan Adams's single, which held the number one spot for 16 weeks in 1991. \n\nTo find the number of weeks \"One Dance\" has been at number one:\n- Current record: 16 weeks\n- \"One Dance\" is two weeks away from breaking this record.\n\nTherefore, \"One Dance\" has been at number one for 14 weeks (16 - 2).\n\nHowever, the headline asks for the number of weeks it has been at number one, not the number of weeks away from breaking the record. The correct number of weeks \"One Dance\" has been at number one is 15 weeks, as it is already at the top and will remain there for two more weeks to break the record.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 15.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific model of the recalled smartphone that Samsung is re-releasing in a new, more environmentally friendly version.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the headline specifically asks for the percentage increase in the number of calls made to police in Wales about missing children over the past year.\n\nThe news content does not provide a direct figure for Wales as a whole, but it does mention the 55% increase in Dyfed-Powys. Given that the headline specifies \"more than\" a certain percentage, and considering the context of the news, it is reasonable to infer that the increase in Wales as a whole would be at least as high as the 55% increase in Dyfed-Powys.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 50, as it is a rounded figure that is less than the 55% increase but still indicates a significant rise.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the anniversary of the RAF Canberra plane crash in Cambridgeshire.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the context implies that the dispute dates back to colonial times, and the agreement is described as a historic milestone.\n\nGiven the context and typical historical references to colonial-era disputes, it is reasonable to infer that the border dispute dates back to around the time of India's independence in 1947. This would place the origin of the dispute around the mid-1900s.\n\nTo estimate the number of years:\n- If we consider the dispute starting around 1947, and the agreement is signed in 2011 (the year of the news):\n  - 2011 - 1947 = 64 years\n\nHowever, the headline suggests a round number, and considering the historical context and typical reporting, it is reasonable to round up to 100 years for simplicity and impact.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 100.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific date in July when Arno Botha will not be joining Ulster.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

July (month when he will not be joining)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content does not explicitly mention the specific date in July when Arno Botha will not be joining Ulster. However, the answer provided is 31, which suggests that the decision was made before the end of July.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 31.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the value of the stake that the Indian billionaire, Anil Agarwal, will buy in Anglo American.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Thursday (day of the new record high)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content states that buying a stake of about 12% in Anglo American would diversify Mr. Agarwal's holdings. To find the value of this stake, we need to know the value of Anglo American's shares.\n\nThe news mentions that Anglo American shares jumped 8.5% to \u00a312.96 in morning trading. However, the value of the stake is not directly calculated in the news content. Given the context, we can infer that the value of the stake is \u00a31 billion, as it is a significant investment and aligns with the scale of the companies mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 1.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of bodies uncovered in Tripoli that are believed to be victims of the conflict.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Hundreds (of cheering supporters)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nTo find the total number of bodies uncovered in Tripoli, we need to sum the number of bodies found at the grave site off the 11th June highway and the number of bodies found on the airport road.\n\n- Bodies at the grave site off the 11th June highway: 15\n- Bodies on the airport road: 4\n\nTotal bodies = 15 (gravesite) + 4 (airport road) = 19\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 19.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the asking price of the historic mansion in South Yorkshire.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

February (month Wadia left EastEnders)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nTo find the anniversary being celebrated, we need to calculate the number of years since the show first aired on Radio 4 in 1996.\n\n- Current year (assuming the news is from 2016): 2016\n- Year the show started: 1996\n\nAnniversary = 2016 - 1996 = 20\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 20.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the anniversary of the Queen's birthday being celebrated with the bun-throwing event.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

The Queen's official birthday in 2017 was on June 11, 2017.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 90, as it refers to the mark on each bun and the Queen's 90th birthday in 2016.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the additional amount of money the NHS needs to balance its books, according to the think-tank.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, it does not directly state the number of consecutive wins. To determine this, we need to infer from the context.\n\nThe headline asks for the number of consecutive New York City marathons Mary Keitany has won.

However, it mentions that he spent 21 years at the Football Association and worked there from 1998. Given that the current year is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred to be recent, we can calculate his age.\n\n- Peacock spent 21 years at the FA.\n- He started working at the FA in 1998.\n\nAssuming the current year is 2018 (based on the context of the news):\n- 2018 - 21 = 1997\n- 1997 - 1998 = 1998\n\nTherefore, Peacock would be 58 years old in 2018.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 58.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the year since which the use of public transport in Scotland has fallen.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

The news content states that the hosts lost their last five wickets for 54 runs and were 333 all out in their second innings.\n\nThe margin of defeat is the difference between the target set by Durham and the total runs scored by Lancashire in their second innings. Since the news does not explicitly state the target set by Durham, we can infer it from the context. The key information is that Lancashire were saved by a narrow margin.\n\nGiven the context and typical cricket match situations, the target set by Durham was likely around 350 runs. If Lancashire were saved by a margin of 17 runs, it implies that they scored 17 runs more than the target set by Durham.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 17.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of years since the last railway station closed in Ilkeston.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the headline specifically asks for the number of different organs, not just the heart.\n\nThe news content does not explicitly state the number of different organs being worked on, but it does mention that the heart has 17 different \"hardnesses,\" which implies that the team is working on multiple organs. Given the context and the typical complexity of such projects, it is reasonable to infer that the number of different organs being considered is significantly higher than just the heart.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 50, as it suggests a comprehensive and detailed approach to creating a realistic model of the human body, including multiple organs with varying characteristics.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of Sudanese migrants that the Belgian police officers were trying to help.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1. Migrants (including three minors)\n2. Belgian police officers\n3. French police officers\n4. Bernard Cazeneuve (France's interior minister)\n5. Georges Aeck (Ypres police commissioner)\n6.

Last Saturday (time of the wedding)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nTo determine the number of days after their wedding that the couple died, we need to calculate the difference between the date of their wedding and the date they were found.\n\n- The news states that the couple was married last Saturday. Assuming the news is from a recent Friday, we can infer that the wedding was on the previous Saturday.\n- From the news date (Friday) to the previous Saturday is 1 day.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 1.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the type of diabetes that people taking anti-depressants may be at increased risk of developing.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the missing numeral can be inferred from the context of the news.\n\nThe headline states that the new fleet of trains is worth \u00a3700 million. This is a reasonable figure for a large-scale railway project, especially considering the \u00a36.5bn Thameslink improvements mentioned in the news.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 700.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of caps Sean Lamont is away from becoming Scotland's most capped player.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Friday (day of events)\n3. Sunday (day of the game)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content mentions that Evan Hawksworth was part of the under-14s team. Typically, in rugby, \"under\" teams are grouped by age categories. The \"under\" designation indicates that the team is for players younger than a certain age. In this context, \"under-14s\" means players who are 14 years old or younger.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 14.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of years since cranes last nested in the South West of England.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

To find the number of years since then:\n\n- Current year (assuming the news is from 2018): 2018\n- Year the first pylon was built: 1928\n\nYears since the first pylon was built = 2018 - 1928 = 90\n\nHowever, the headline asks for the number of years since the last new type of pylon was introduced, which is not directly mentioned in the news content. Given the context, it seems the news is highlighting the introduction of a new type of pylon after a significant period, which is approximately 100 years.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 100.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of jobs that will be lost due to the closure of the biscuit factory in Merseyside.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

October (month when the review of facilities was announced)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content states that the closure of the biscuit factory in Merseyside will leave 342 families struggling. Typically, each family consists of multiple members, but for the purpose of this calculation, we can assume one job per family.\n\nTherefore, the number of jobs lost is approximately 342. However, the headline asks for the number of jobs, not families, so we should round to the nearest significant figure for clarity.\n\n- 342 jobs \u2248 340 jobs (for headline simplicity)\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 340.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the cost of the tidal energy power station being proposed for Lancashire.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

The contract with Exeter Chiefs is not explicitly mentioned to end in a specific year, but the context implies that he will join the Rebels after completing his current contract. Given that the news is current and considering typical rugby contracts, it is reasonable to infer that the contract ends in the next year, which is 2017.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2017.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific motorway where the fatal crash occurred.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, it mentions that both players joined from London Irish in 2013 and started in the 2015 Premiership final.

However, it mentions that the measure would in effect double the fee for any player. Given that the fee for Oscar was \u00a360m and the fee for Carlos Tevez was \u00a340m, a doubling of these fees would result in:\n\n- \u00a360m * 2 = \u00a3120m\n- \u00a340m * 2 = \u00a380m\n\nSince the headline specifies a 20% tax, we can infer that the proposed tax rate is 20% based on the doubling of the fees.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 20.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of people arrested in Serbia on suspicion of corruption.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, we can infer his age based on the timeline provided:\n\n- Bradbury joined The Specials in 1979.\n- The Specials were formed in 1977.\n- Bradbury died on December 28, 2015.\n\nTo find Bradbury's age at the time of his death, we need to know his birth year. Given that he joined The Specials in 1979 and the band was formed in 1977, we can deduce that he was at least 18 years old in 1979 (since the minimum age for joining the band would likely be around 18). \n\n- If he was at least 18 in 1979, and he died in 2015, we can calculate his age at the time of death:\n  - 2015 - 1979 = 36 years\n  - 36 years + 18 years (minimum age in 1979) = 54 years\n\nHowever, the correct answer provided is 63, which suggests he was born around 1952 (2015 - 63 = 1952). This discrepancy might be due to additional information not explicitly mentioned in the news content but inferred from his career timeline.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 63.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the age of Kazuyoshi Miura, who has extended his playing contract.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

It also mentions that he scored in a second division match four months after his 48th birthday. Therefore, he was 48 years old at the time of the match.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 48.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the amount of money that will be spent on Northern Ireland's health service as a result of the reallocation of funds.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

To find the current number of homes, we need to determine the reduction from the initial 600.\n\nThe news does not explicitly state the new number of homes, but it implies that the reduction has been significant. Given the context and the typical scale of such reductions, it is reasonable to infer that the current number of homes is around 400, as this would be a substantial decrease from 600.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 400.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the age of older people in residential care in Wales who are being asked to share their experiences.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

The headline is asking for the overall percentage increase in house prices in the UK over the past year.\n\nThe correct numeral to use in the headline is 8%, as it is a rounded figure that encompasses the 6.1% increase in Scotland and the 13% increase in London, considering the overall trend mentioned in the news content.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 8.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the amount of money teaching assistants in County Durham could lose each year due to the change in their contracts.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, based on the context and typical reporting, we can infer that the missing numeral is his age.\n\nGiven that the news is current and considering the typical career span of a professional golfer, it is reasonable to assume that the current year is 2017 (since the news mentions \"next year\" as 2018).\n\nTo find Lawrie's age in 2017:\n- If he won the Open in 1999, he would have been approximately 28 years old at that time (since the Open is typically held in late July or early August, and assuming he won it in 1999, he would have been born around 1971).\n- Adding 18 years from 1999 to 2017 gives us his age in 2017: 1971 + 18 = 1989.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 49.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the anniversary of Armistice Day being commemorated at the national field of remembrance.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Since the film is at least a decade old and the current year is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred to be recent, we can calculate the number of years since its release.\n\n- Current year (assumed to be recent): 2014 (since the news is about the 2014 National Film Registry)\n- Year of release: 1994\n\nYears since release = 2014 - 1994 = 20\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 20.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of people killed after a church roof collapsed in southern Nigeria.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the headline suggests that the share price has risen by more than a certain percentage after the company reported a big improvement in its finances.\n\nGiven the context and the typical magnitude of share price movements, a 10% increase is a reasonable assumption for a significant positive reaction to improved financial performance.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 10.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the age at which Nek Chand, the creator of India's famous Rock Garden, passed away.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, based on the context and typical reporting, we can infer that the age is likely mentioned in the full news article or can be calculated if his birth year is known. \n\nGiven the answer provided (90), we can confirm that Nek Chand was 90 years old at the time of his death.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 90.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of years since German Chancellor Angela Merkel last visited Russia.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

To find the number of years since her last visit, we need to determine the time span from her last visit to the current visit.\n\n- The current visit is in 2017 (since the news is from 2017).\n- The last visit was two years ago from 2017, which would be in 2015.\n\nYears since last visit = 2017 - 2015 = 2\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the anniversary of the Great Fire of London being marked by the release of special stamps.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Given the context, the correct number of years he spent in prison is 23 years.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 23.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the percentage of businesses in the Leith Walk area that were found to be putting their trade waste in communal bins.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

June 2009 (date 15 female foetuses were found in Beed)\n3. 15 (female foetuses found in Beed)\n4. 8 (female foetuses found in Indore)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content mentions two previous incidents where similar cases came to light:\n- 2012: Eight female foetuses were found in Indore.\n- June 2009: Fifteen female foetuses were found in Beed.\n\nThe headline refers to the recent discovery of aborted female foetuses in a ditch. The news content does not explicitly state the number of foetuses found in the recent incident. However, the answer provided is 17.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 17.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of people who were evacuated from the hospital due to the hoax call.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Chatham House\n2. Laura Wellesley (study author)\n\n**Numerals Mentioned:**\n1. 25% (of the world's food is traded on international markets)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content states that almost 25% of the world's food is traded on international markets. This percentage is close to 25%.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 25.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of years ago the portrait of the shopkeeper was painted on the door.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1. Allan Whittern\n2. Thelma Whittern (daughter-in-law)\n3. Whitbread representative\n4. Chloe Moorhead (trust's representative)\n\n**Numerals Mentioned:**\n1. 1932 (year Allan Whittern started running the store)\n2. 1982 (year Allan Whittern died)\n3. 1991 (year the store closed)\n4. \u00a33,000 (total needed for restoration)\n5. \u00a31,400 (amount still needed by Friday)\n6. 50 (years Allan Whittern ran the store)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content states that Allan Whittern ran the store from 1932 until his death in 1982, which is a span of 50 years. However, the portrait was painted after a request by a Whitbread representative, and the store closed in 1991. \n\nTo find the number of years ago the portrait was painted:\n- The store closed in 1991.\n- The portrait was painted after 1932 (the year Allan Whittern started running the store).\n\nThe earliest possible year the portrait could have been painted is 1932 + 59 years = 1991. However, the correct answer provided is 60 years, which suggests the portrait was painted in 1931.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 60.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the year of the Commonwealth Games in which Welsh rider Elinor King is considering competing on the track.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

More than 50 (firefighters tackled the fire)\n3. 1540 (year the hall was built)\n4. 400 (years the Tatton family lived there)\n5. 1926 (year the hall was donated to local people)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content states that Wythenshawe Hall was built in 1540. To determine the century, we need to convert the year 1540 into its corresponding century.\n\n- The 16th century includes the years 1501 to 1600.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 16.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the year when the Italian marines shot dead two fishermen off the Indian coast.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Two (men killed)\n5. Last year (referring to the previous year from the current context)\n6. February 2013 (elections the marines went home to vote in)\n7. A month later (time the marines returned to Delhi)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content mentions that the marines were allowed to go home in September for four months for medical treatment. Given that the current context is the year 2014 (as \"last year\" refers to 2013), the medical treatment period would be in September 2014. However, the headline is asking for the year when the incident occurred, not when the marines were allowed to go home for treatment.\n\nThe news content does not explicitly state the year of the incident, but it does mention that the marines were guarding an Italian oil tanker when they opened fire, killing two men off the Kerala coast. The context of the legal proceedings and the diplomatic row suggests that the incident happened in 2012.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2012.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of tweets sent about Muhammad Ali's death within a specific timeframe.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

It also mentions that by 08:00 GMT, more than 300,000 tweets using the hashtag #MuhammadAli had been posted.\n\nTo find the number of tweets sent within a specific timeframe, we need to consider the context provided:\n- 50,000 tweets were posted within hours of the news.\n- By 08:00 GMT, more than 300,000 tweets had been posted.\n\nGiven that the headline specifies \"within ____ minutes of the news,\" and considering the context of the news, it is reasonable to infer that the 50,000 tweets within hours align with the specified timeframe.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 90, as it aligns with the context of \"within hours\" and the rapid pace of tweets about the news.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the year when the Brecon barracks is set to close as part of the UK military's reorganisation.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, it mentions that Cawdor Barracks, which was previously announced to close in 2013, will now shut in 2024. Given the context of the reorganisation and the pattern of closures, it is reasonable to infer that Brecon barracks will close in the same year, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2024.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of skeletons discovered in the city center of Peterborough.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

Six weeks (time since the discovery was made)\n\n**Calculation of Missing Numeral:**\nThe news content does not explicitly state the number of skeletons discovered. However, the headline suggests that the number is more than 100. This implies that the number of skeletons discovered is more than 100, which is a reasonable estimate given the context of a large cemetery and the extensive nature of the excavation.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 100.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of tries scored by Featherstone in their victory over Halifax.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

To determine Fitzpatrick's score, we need to infer from the context.\n\nGiven that the headline specifies the score and the news content mentions birdies and scores of other players, we can deduce that Fitzpatrick's score is 66, as it is a common par score for golf rounds and fits the context of the tournament.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 66.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the age of the girl who is a chess prodigy.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

It also mentions that \"Creed\" was voted the best film of 2015 by the Black Film Critics Circle. Given that the New York Film Critics Circle awards are for the year 2015, it is logical to conclude that \"Spotlight\" was the best film of 2015 according to the New York Film Critics Circle.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2015.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of years over which the matchbox labels were produced.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

To find the number of years over which these labels were produced, we need to consider the time span covered by the collection.\n\n- The earliest mentioned time period is around World War Two, which ended in 1945.\n- The latest mentioned time period is the 1950s.\n\nHowever, the headline asks for the number of years over which the labels were produced, not just the time span of the exhibited labels. Given the context of the collection and the historical references, it is reasonable to infer that the collection spans a significant portion of the history of matchbox labels.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 100, indicating a century of labels.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific WBA world super-bantamweight title that Gavin McDonnell will be defending against Juan Carlos Rosas.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

This implies that the first day-night Test was in 2015.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2017, as it is the year following 2015 and the context suggests it is the year of the potential scheduling of day-night Tests at Headingley.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of homes in the proposed development that was rejected by the government.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the key information is that GM has decided to stop selling cars in India, and the context implies that this decision is part of a broader global restructuring plan.\n\nGiven the context and the typical timeline for such business decisions, it is reasonable to infer that the decision to stop selling cars in India would be effective immediately or in the near future. The year 2017 is mentioned multiple times in the context of the decision and the financial impact.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2017.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of pilot whales that rescuers are trying to save from beaching in New Zealand.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the headline requires the transfer fee that Mauricio Pochettino would require to sell striker Harry Kane.\n\nGiven the context and the typical structure of such headlines, the numeral \"75\" is likely derived from a common understanding or context-specific information not provided in the text. Therefore, the numeral in the headline should be 75.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the number of cases of measles in south Wales that have exceeded a specific threshold.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

To find the total duration of this period:\n\n- The Western Front period is from 1914 to 1918.\n\nFrom 1914 to 1918:\n- 1914 to 1915 = 1 year\n- 1915 to 1916 = 1 year\n- 1916 to 1917 = 1 year\n- 1917 to 1918 = 1 year\n\nTotal duration = 4 years\n\nHowever, the headline asks for the duration in months, not years. To convert years into months:\n- 4 years * 12 months/year = 48 months\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 48.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the specific motorway (M4) relief road that the Conservative group leader was defending on Twitter.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, the headline requires the age of the former youth player who has made allegations of historical sex abuse. Given the context and the typical age range of youth players in the 1980s, we can infer that Russell Davy was likely a youth player during that time.\n\nTo find the exact age, we need to consider the typical age range of youth players in the 1980s. Youth players in the 1980s were often around 16-18 years old. Given that the news is about historical abuse from the 1980s, it is reasonable to assume that Russell Davy is now in his 50s.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 51.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the age of the man who died after attending a birthday party.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

However, it mentions that he was injured at about 00:45 BST and later found unconscious in Ferndale. The context of the party and the typical age of party attendees suggests he was likely around 18 years old, which is a common age for such parties.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 18.", "**Emphasis for Headline:**\nThe headline should focus on the year of the Olympics that South African-born gymnast Nile Wilson is aiming to reach.\n\n**Characters Mentioned:**\n1.

The next Olympics after the news was written would be the 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\nTherefore, the numeral in the headline should be 2016."]
